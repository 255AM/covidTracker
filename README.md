# covidTracker
This is a project for codeLouisville's Javascript September 2020 course. The app downloads data from a remote csv file located at https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data, 
parses and graphs the data. Data and charts are shown for US statistics as well as US states, which are selectable by a dropdown box.
CodeLouisville requires that a minimum of 3 optional features must be met to pass the course. Here are the the features my project covers.

-Read and parse an external file (such as JSON or CSV) into your application and display some data from that in your app
    My project reads data from a remote CSV file and uses the data to create charts and summarize.
    
-Create an array, dictionary or list, populate it with multiple values, retrieve at least one value, and use or display it in your application
    Multiple arrays are created in my project to easily find data

-Create and use a function that accepts two or more values(parameters), calculates or determines a new value based on those inputs, and returns a new value
    The drawChart function brings in multiple values and defines and creates a chart each time
    
-Visualize data in a graph, chart, or other visual representation of data
    The main premise of the app is to create charts based on Covid data
    
To use app, open index.html. US data and Alabama (default) state data will be charted. Select a new state with the drop down box in the center of the page. The state level charts
    will updata
